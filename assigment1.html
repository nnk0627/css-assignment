			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>A bamboo cutter named Sanuki no Miyatsuko discovers a miniature girl inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a divine presence, he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her "Princess". The girl grows rapidly, earning her the nickname "Takenoko" (Little Bamboo) from the other village children. Sutemaru, the oldest among Kaguya's friends, develops a close relationship with her.Miyatsuko comes upon gold and fine cloth in the bamboo grove in the same way he found his daughter. He takes these as proof of her divine royalty and begins planning to make her a proper princess. He relocates the family to the capital, forcing Kaguya to leave her friends behind, and the family moves into a mansion replete with servants. Kaguya is soon saddled with a governess who is tasked with taming her into a noblewoman. Kaguya struggles with the restraints of nobility, yearning for her prior life in the countryside. </p>
